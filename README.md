# Example C# Web Application
## Developed using the [ASP.NET Core MVC pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-2.2) and [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

This project is based on the [MVC tutorial written by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-2.2), which walks developers through making a web app with the ASP.NET Core MVC design pattern.  The tutorial shows you how to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server ([Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express)), however I made some changes so that it connects to a MySQL Server ([Community](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)).  The Microsoft solution works great, but it can [only handle databases up to 10 GB in size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017?view=sql-server-2017#Cross-BoxScaleLimits "After opening link, scroll to bottom of table.").  As for the MySQL solution, the maximum database/table file size is only restricted by the OS, and [a single table can be as large as 256 TB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/table-size-limit.html) with default settings (max is 65,536TB).
